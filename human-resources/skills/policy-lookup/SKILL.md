## Quality Standards

- [ ] Policy explanation uses plain language; no jargon without definition
- [ ] Specific eligibility criteria are clearly stated
- [ ] Process steps are actionable and in order
- [ ] Legal context is provided but flagged as general guidance, not legal advice
- [ ] Edge cases and exceptions are addressed
- [ ] Contact information or escalation path is suggested for complex situations

## Important Disclaimers

Always include when providing policy guidance:

1. **Not legal advice**: This is general HR guidance, not legal counsel. For legally sensitive situations, consult employment law counsel.
2. **Company-specific**: Actual company policies supersede general guidance. Always refer to the official employee handbook.
3. **Jurisdiction matters**: Employment law varies significantly by state, country, and locality. Verify local requirements.
4. **Currency of information**: Policies and laws change. Verify against the most current version.

## Edge Cases

- **Policy conflicts**: When company policy appears to conflict with law, flag it and recommend legal review
- **Unwritten policies**: If the user describes a practice with no written policy, recommend formalizing it
- **Multi-state employees**: Identify which state's law applies (usually where work is performed)
- **International employees**: Flag that US-centric advice may not apply; recommend local HR or counsel
- **Union environments**: Note that CBA terms may override standard company policies
- **Pending policy changes**: If discussing a policy area undergoing legislative change, note the uncertainty
