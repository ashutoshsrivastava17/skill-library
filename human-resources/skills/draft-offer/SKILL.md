## Jurisdiction-Specific Considerations

| Jurisdiction | Key Requirements |
|-------------|-----------------|
| California | No non-competes; pay transparency required; must include pay range |
| New York | Pay transparency law; salary range disclosure |
| Colorado | Must include benefits description and compensation range |
| EU / UK | Must reference contract terms, notice period, GDPR data processing |
| Canada | Provincial employment standards; statutory minimums |
| India | Must reference gratuity, PF, statutory bonus |
| Australia | Fair Work Act compliance; National Employment Standards |

## Edge Cases

- **Counter-offer scenario**: If the candidate is comparing offers, emphasize total comp and growth opportunity
- **Relocation**: Include relocation package details, temporary housing, and moving allowance
- **Visa sponsorship**: Note visa type, sponsorship commitment, and any start date dependencies
- **Internal transfer**: Adjust tone — less "welcome" more "congratulations on your new role"
- **Executive offers**: May require board approval language, severance terms, change-of-control provisions
- **Contract-to-hire**: Specify conversion terms, timeline, and how comp changes at conversion
- **Part-time offers**: Prorate salary, clarify benefits eligibility, state expected hours

## Legal Disclaimer

Always include a note that:
- The letter is not a contract of employment (in at-will jurisdictions)
- Final terms are subject to completion of contingencies
- Recommend the candidate consult with their own advisor if they have questions
- The user should have their legal team review the final letter before sending
