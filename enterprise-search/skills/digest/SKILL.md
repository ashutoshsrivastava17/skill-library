# Enterprise Activity Digest

Generate comprehensive activity digests that aggregate updates across email, chat, documents, wikis, tickets, and other connected enterprise sources.

## Digest Generation Process

### Step 1: Determine Scope and Parameters

| Parameter       | Options                              | Default        |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|----------------|
| Time range      | daily, weekly, custom date range     | daily (24h)    |
| Sources         | all, or specific tools               | all connected  |
| Focus           | mentions, team, project, topic       | all activity   |
| Audience        | individual, team, leadership         | individual     |
| Priority filter | critical-only, high+, all            | high+          |

Parse the user's request to extract:
- **Period**: "daily", "weekly", "since Monday", "last 3 days"
- **Filters**: team names, project names, specific people, topics
- **Format**: brief, detailed, executive summary

### Step 2: Gather Activity from Sources

Collect updates from each connected source in this priority order:

1. **Direct mentions and assignments** - Highest priority; anything where the user was @mentioned, assigned, or directly addressed
2. **Action items and deadlines** - Tasks due, overdue, or newly assigned
3. **Thread and conversation updates** - Active discussions the user participates in
4. **Document changes** - Edits to documents the user owns or watches
5. **Team activity** - Updates from the user's team channels and projects
6. **Organizational announcements** - Company-wide or department-wide updates

### Step 3: Categorize and Prioritize

Assign each item a priority level:

| Priority   | Criteria                                              | Icon |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------|
| Critical   | Blocking issues, urgent mentions, overdue deadlines   | !!   |
| High       | Direct mentions, approaching deadlines, review requests| !   |
| Medium     | Team updates, document changes, active threads        | -    |
| Low        | FYI announcements, resolved items, informational      | .    |

### Step 4: Generate the Digest

## Output Format

```
# [Daily/Weekly] Digest — [Date or Date Range]
Sources checked: [list of sources queried]

## Needs Your Attention (Critical & High)
- [!!] [Source Icon] **Item title** — Brief description
  Action needed: [specific action required]
  Due: [deadline if applicable]

- [!] [Source Icon] **Item title** — Brief description
  Context: [relevant context]

## Updates & Activity
### [Source Name]
- **[Item]** — [Summary of update] ([timestamp])

### [Source Name]
- **[Item]** — [Summary of update] ([timestamp])

## Action Items Summary
- [ ] [Action item 1] — Due [date] — Source: [source]
- [ ] [Action item 2] — Due [date] — Source: [source]
- [ ] [Action item 3] — Due [date] — Source: [source]

## Trends & Patterns
- [Notable pattern, e.g., "5 new tickets in Project X this week, up from 2 last week"]
- [Recurring topic or emerging theme]

## Stats
| Source     | New Items | Mentions | Action Items |
|------------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| Email      | X         | X        | X            |
| Chat       | X         | X        | X            |
| Docs       | X         | X        | X            |
| Tickets    | X         | X        | X            |
| Wiki       | X         | X        | X            |
```

## Digest Variants

### Daily Standup Digest
Optimized for standup meetings:
- What was completed yesterday
- What is planned for today
- Blockers and dependencies identified across tools

### Weekly Leadership Digest
Optimized for managers and leadership:
- Team velocity and throughput metrics
- Cross-team dependencies and blockers
- Key decisions made and pending
- Risk items requiring escalation

### Project-Focused Digest
Filtered to a specific project:
- All activity related to the project across every source
- Progress against milestones
- Open questions and unresolved threads

## Quality Standards

- **Deduplication**: If the same event appears in multiple sources (e.g., a ticket update that also triggered a chat notification), consolidate into one entry referencing both sources
- **Recency**: Always show the most recent state, not intermediate states
- **Actionability**: Every "Needs Your Attention" item must include a clear next action
- **Brevity**: Summaries should be one line; expand only when the user requests detail
- **Time zones**: Display all times in the user's local time zone
- **Completeness**: If a source is unavailable or errored, note it clearly rather than silently omitting

## Edge Cases

- **No activity**: Report "No new activity in [source] for this period" rather than omitting the source
- **Too much activity**: If more than 50 items in a category, summarize with counts and show top 10, offering to expand
- **Partial data**: If a source returned incomplete results (e.g., API rate limit), flag it with a warning
- **New sources**: If a source was recently connected, note that historical data may be limited
- **Overlapping periods**: For weekly digests, avoid repeating items already covered in daily digests unless they have new updates

## Follow-Up Actions

After presenting the digest, offer:
1. "Want me to expand on any item?"
2. "Should I search for more context on [top item]?"
3. "Want me to draft responses to any pending mentions?"
4. "Should I create tasks for the action items?"
